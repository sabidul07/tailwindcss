        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1. The display of your Trade Account in the profile search is ranked by us using an algorithm based on various parameters. We have set out below the main parameters taken into account in order to improve the predictability of the ranking and help you optimise the presentation of your Trade Account and services. The following parameters determine your ranking and are set out below in order of importance and weighting applied:</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1.1. Relevance: only those Tradespeople who offer the specific trades and/or services requested in a particular Job are displayed in the ranking list.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1.2. Geographical proximity: it is generally important for the Customer to find a Tradesperson who is not too far away from the location of the Job, because a short distance usually leads to faster availability of the Tradesperson and lower costs for the Customer.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1.3. Customer Feedback: Feedback from Customers can be a valuable indication for the Customer as to whether these Customers have been satisfied with your services and behaviour in the past. The better your rating, the higher up you will appear in the ranking for the Customer.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1.4. Interactions with Customers: your activity on the MyBuilder Platform can indicate how quickly you Express Interest in Leads, Shortlisting and other communications. We therefore evaluate how many replies you sent in the week before the Job was created by the Customer and whether these replies related to comparable Jobs. The higher the number of answers, the higher up you will appear in the ranking for the Customer.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3"> 6.1.5. Randomisation: we want to ensure that even Tradespeople who have only been active on the MyBuilder Platform for a short time and therefore have a lower chance of scoring on the other ranking parameters have a chance of getting the Job. We therefore allow a Tradesperson who has been active on the MyBuilder Platform for 2 months or less to be ranked higher than they otherwise would be based on our ranking parameters. This is a purely random selection of the Tradesperson and the place that they appear except for them appearing higher than they otherwise might be. These new Tradespeople will also be ranked according to the main parameters mentioned above.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">6.2. Neither the ranking we carry out nor your position in any ranking can be influenced directly or indirectly by the payment of any fees. </p>

        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">11.2. On receipt of a complaint, we will:</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">11.2.1. carefully consider the complaint and, if necessary, follow up in order to adequately address any issues raised;</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">11.2.2. process the complaint within a reasonable period of time taking into account the importance and complexity of the issue raised; and</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">11.2.3. inform the complainant of the result of our complaint handling process.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">We try to resolve all complaints by amicable and reasonable discussion. If the complaint cannot be resolved in this way, either of us can request mediation in accordance with clause 11.3.</p>
        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">11.3. Alternative dispute resolution is an optional process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. You can submit a complaint to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”) through their website at www.cedr.com/submit-a-complaint/. CEDR does not charge you for making a complaint. If you're not satisfied with the outcome you can still go to court.</p>

        <p  class="text-[#6B677A] mt-3">13.7.1. If any provisions hereof are held to be illegal or unenforceable, such provisions shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless the business purpose of this Agreement is substantially frustrated.</p>
